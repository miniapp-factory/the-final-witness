#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **`mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`** – create a new file that describes the logo you want to generate.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

#### Can we chance the title which is the "The final Case"  

I need the file that contains the title to create the SEARCH/REPLACE block.  
Please add **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** to the chat so I can edit it.
